  description = "I am a full stack web developer currently working on the IIAB(Internet In A Box) Project at Wikimedia Foundation as part of Google Summer of Code '20. I have experience in working with modern web development tools like JSX, Rest APIs, Webpack, ES6, Django, Python, and Firebase. I am currently a sophomore at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra studying Computer Science and Engineering with expected graduation in 2022. I love fiddling with new technology, and am ever ready to try out new technology and frameworks.My current poison of choice is learning the core mathematics behind machine learning algorithms.   When I'm not in front of my laptop, I'm usually on my phone. Okay, I'm not a cyborg, and I do play the guitar and do a failed attempt at solving the Rubik's cube."
