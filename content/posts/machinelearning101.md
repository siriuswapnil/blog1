# The mystery behind the field of Machine Learning:

Traditionally, as computer programmers, our job is to provide instructions to the computer to perform an action. We do this via a programming language.

In Machine Learning, the computer is not provided clear instructions. Rather, it is given a set of template data(formally known as *model* in the ML world). The computer attempts to *learn* instructions in accordance to the provided model automatically.

Now learning can be classified into 3 types, namely : 

## Supervised Learning
Here, learning occurs on the basis of pre-provided pairs of data(*labeleed training data*). By pair, we mean, containing an input object(vector) and a desired output value(called the supervisory signal).

A supervised learning algorithm, analyzes the training data,and provides an inferred function that can be used for mapping new examples.

A simple example can be predicting the house prices.
Provided the past prices and the house area, the algorithm can predict for a given house area, what will be the price.


## Unsupervised Learning



### Reinforcement Learing
