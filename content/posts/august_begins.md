# Welcome August
So here begins August, another new month in these trying times. Its now 6 months since, I've been away from college. Wish to achieve things in a systematic manner this month. Crucial is the implementation of SMART goals.

This month's targets include : 
- Complete GSoC work according to the expectations of my mentors
- Take part in PyTorch Hackathon, deadline is 25th August - For that need to learn ML first, more on that later.
- Learn ML on a weekly basis.
- Practise coding with DSA in python with weekly targets.


I've been having a lot of thinking issues lately. I believe all this is coming from being part of a hackathon that wwoulld enable me to reinfore whatever I've learnt. From what I've seen, my mind takes a toll when I see a lot of achievements by poeple around.

## Coding
For improving my technical interview skills, I'm going to start with a four week plan this August : 

* Week 1 (1-7) - Python syntax, OOP, + DSA brushup (finish with basic implementation)
* Week 2 (8-14) - Leetcode Easy+Medium
* Week 3 (15-21) - Leetcode More easy Medium
* Week 4 - (22-28) - Leetcode Hard
* Remaining 2 Days = Practice mixed bag revision and figure out weak areas

## Machine Learning
For ML, I will be following the curriculum by IITB WnCC, one week ML Guide. Will focus on building strong foundations, rather than using libraries like Tf

## Google Summer of Code
The task this phase is to finally incorporate the changes made, with the automation, to the admin panel, will do that. The automation part is done, integrating the scripts with the frontend is all what's left.



Happy Fall to everyone!
